# AMS A3 Motion Simulator UDP Library
This is a small library that enables you to control Atomic Motion System's A3 motion platform, via SIMPHYNITY. All this library really does is provide a neat interface to a UDP client, which sends data to SIMPHYNITY.

SIMPHYNITY must be in UDP mode in order for this to work. A test file, `test.py`, is also provided to give you an idea of how to use this.

## But there's no documentation?
I'll get it to it when I have time, I promise!
